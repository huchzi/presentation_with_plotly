```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(plotly)
```

## Show the dataset

My plot is based on the cars dataset. This dataset consists of two variables: speed in mph and stopping distance in feet.

```{r, echo = T}

data(cars)

head(cars)

```

## Plot with ggplotly

```{r show plot, warning = F, echo = F}

p <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  scale_x_continuous("Speed") +
  scale_y_continuous("Stopping distance")

ggplotly(p)

```
